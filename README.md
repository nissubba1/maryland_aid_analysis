## Comprehensive Analysis and Interpretation
There are serious of questions to guide the analysis of Maryland's aid distribution

### General Overview of Maryland Aid (2009 - 2023)
1. **Question 1:** How much total aid did Maryland distribute from 2009 to 2023?
```postgresql
SELECT
    TO_CHAR(SUM(amount), '$FM999,999,999,999.00') AS total_aid_amount
FROM
    maryland_aids_09_23;
```
| total_aid_amount    |
|:-------------------:|
| $15,900,914,821.46 |

Maryland distributed over $15 billion in aid from 2009 to 2023. This substantial amount reflects Maryland's commitment to supporting numerous agencies and programs, highlighting the operational costs required to manage various departments within the state government.

2. **Question 2:** How many individual aid distributions did Maryland make from 2009 to 2023?

```postgresql
SELECT
    COUNT(*) AS num_of_records
FROM
    maryland_aids_09_23;
```

| num_of_records |
|:--------------:|
|     19482      |

Maryland provided a total of 19,482 individual aids, which shows the state's extensive efforts in supporting a wide range of needs.

### Trends and Patterns
3. **Question 3:** What is the trend in the total amount of aid distributed from 2009 to 2023?

```postgresql
SELECT
    fiscal_year,
    TO_CHAR(SUM(amount), '$FM999,999,999,999.00') AS total_aids,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC)
FROM
    maryland_aids_09_23
GROUP BY
    fiscal_year
ORDER BY
    fiscal_year;
```

| fiscal_year |     total_aids     | rank |
|:-----------:|:------------------:|-----:|
|     2009    |  $552,274,922.22   |   13 |
|     2010    |  $468,824,406.89   |   15 |
|     2011    |  $534,060,484.97   |   14 |
|     2012    |  $726,726,970.33   |   11 |
|     2013    |  $723,862,906.76   |   12 |
|     2014    |  $802,351,149.95   |   10 |
|     2015    | $1,061,257,284.94  |    5 |
|     2016    |  $826,133,142.66   |    9 |
|     2017    |  $905,479,311.53   |    8 |
|     2018    |  $909,053,635.53   |    7 |
|     2019    |  $985,965,431.93   |    6 |
|     2020    | $2,396,452,132.47  |    1 |
|     2021    | $1,579,702,378.00  |    4 |
|     2022    | $1,612,689,724.11  |    3 |
|     2023    | $1,816,080,939.17  |    2 |


There is a general upward trend in Maryland's aid distribution from 2009 to 2023. However, a significant increase occurred from 2019 to 2020, likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Before 2020, Maryland distributed less than one billion annually, but in 2020, this amount surged to over 2.3 billion. While aid was steadily increasing from 2009 to 2019, the pandemic caused a more drastic rise, likely as Maryland provided more support to help businesses, departments, and agencies remain operational during the crisis.

4. **Question 4:** What is the trend in the number of individual aids given out from 2009 to 2023?

```postgresql
SELECT
    fiscal_year,
    COUNT(*) AS num_of_aids,
    RANK() OVER ( ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC)
FROM
    maryland_aids_09_23
GROUP BY
    fiscal_year;
```
| fiscal_year | num_of_aids | rank |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|-----:|
|     2020    |     2549     |    1 |
|     2021    |     1801     |    2 |
|     2023    |     1717     |    3 |
|     2022    |     1407     |    4 |
|     2017    |     1353     |    5 |
|     2018    |     1331     |    6 |
|     2016    |     1209     |    7 |
|     2019    |     1177     |    8 |
|     2012    |     1158     |    9 |
|     2015    |     1109     |   10 |
|     2013    |     1077     |   11 |
|     2014    |     1050     |   12 |
|     2011    |     1036     |   13 |
|     2009    |      819     |   14 |
|     2010    |      689     |   15 |


The data shows a correlation with the previous findings: Maryland distributed the highest number of individual aids in 2020 due to the pandemic. In 2020, over 2,500 different aids were given out, more than double the 1,100 aids distributed in 2019. However, following 2020, there was a downward trend in the number of aids distributed, possibly due to the decline in COVID-19 cases and the reopening of businesses, allowing people to return to work.

5. **Question 5:** Are there any inconsistencies between the total amount of aid and the number of aids given? For instance, was there a year when more individual aids were given, but the total aid amount was less compared to another year?

```postgresql
WITH
    total_aids AS (SELECT
                       fiscal_year,
                       TO_CHAR(SUM(amount), '$FM999,999,999,999.00') AS total_aids,
                       RANK() OVER ( ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC) AS sum_aids_rank
                   FROM
                       maryland_aids_09_23
                   GROUP BY fiscal_year),
    aids_count AS (SELECT
                       fiscal_year,
                       COUNT(*) AS num_of_aids,
                       RANK() OVER ( ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) AS aids_count_rank
                   FROM
                       maryland_aids_09_23
                   GROUP BY fiscal_year)
SELECT
    ta.fiscal_year,
    ta.total_aids,
    ac.num_of_aids,
    ta.sum_aids_rank,
    ac.aids_count_rank
FROM
    total_aids ta,
    aids_count ac
WHERE
    ta.fiscal_year = ac.fiscal_year;
```

| fiscal_year |    total_aids     | num_of_aids | sum_aids_rank | aids_count_rank |
|:-----------:|:-----------------:|:-----------:|--------------:|----------------:|
|    2020     | $2,396,452,132.47 |     2549    |             1 |               1 |
|    2023     | $1,816,080,939.17 |     1717    |             2 |               3 |
|    2022     | $1,612,689,724.11 |     1407    |             3 |               4 |
|    2021     | $1,579,702,378.00 |     1801    |             4 |               2 |
|    2015     | $1,061,257,284.94 |     1109    |             5 |              10 |
|    2019     | $985,965,431.93   |     1177    |             6 |               8 |
|    2018     | $909,053,635.53   |     1331    |             7 |               6 |
|    2017     | $905,479,311.53   |     1353    |             8 |               5 |
|    2016     | $826,133,142.66   |     1209    |             9 |               7 |
|    2014     | $802,351,149.95   |     1050    |            10 |              12 |
|    2012     | $726,726,970.33   |     1158    |            11 |               9 |
|    2013     | $723,862,906.76   |     1077    |            12 |              11 |
|    2009     | $552,274,922.22   |      819    |            13 |              14 |
|    2011     | $534,060,484.97   |     1036    |            14 |              13 |
|    2010     | $468,824,406.89   |      689    |            15 |              15 |


Overall, the number of aids distributed and the total amount of aid generally align. However, 2015 stands out as an exception. Although 2015 ranks fifth in total aid amount, it ranks tenth in the number of aids given, indicating that fewer, but larger, aids were distributed in that year.

### Aid Categories and Distribution

6. **Question 6:** What are the different categories of aids distributed by Maryland?

```postgresql
SELECT
    category
FROM
    maryland_aids_09_23
GROUP BY
    category;
```
| category |
|:--------:|
|  Grant   |
|   Loan   |
| Unknown  |
| Contract |


Maryland provides four types of aid: Grant, Loan, Contract, and Unknown (where the type of aid is unspecified).

7. **Question 7:** Rank each aid category based on the total amount of aid distributed within that category.

```postgresql
SELECT
    category,
    TO_CHAR(SUM(amount), '$FM999,999,999,999.00') AS total_aid,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY SUM(amount) DESC) AS rank_order
FROM
    maryland_aids_09_23
GROUP BY
    category;
```

| category |     total_aid      | rank_order |
|:--------:|:------------------:|-----------:|
|  Grant   | $15,181,280,034.25 |          1 |
|   Loan   | $718,999,616.54    |          2 |
| Unknown  | $435,481.67        |          3 |
| Contract | $199,689.00        |          4 |


Grants are by far the largest category, totaling over 15 billion. The next highest category is loans, which amount to just over 700 million.

8. **Question 8:** What is the distribution of each aid type? For example, what percentage of total aid did grants and loans make up?

```postgresql
WITH
    category_totals AS (SELECT
                            category,
                            SUM(amount) AS category_total_aid
                        FROM
                            maryland_aids_09_23
                        GROUP BY category),
    overall_total AS (SELECT
                          SUM(amount) AS total_aid
                      FROM
                          maryland_aids_09_23)
SELECT
    ct.category AS category_type,
    TO_CHAR(ct.category_total_aid, '$FM999,999,999,999.00') AS total_aids,
    TRUNC(((ct.category_total_aid::NUMERIC / ot.total_aid) * 100), 3) AS "percentage (%)"
FROM
    category_totals ct,
    overall_total ot;
```
|  category_type  |     total_aids     | percentage (%) |
|:---------------:|:------------------:|---------------:|
|      Grant      | $15,181,280,034.25 |         95.474 |
|      Loan       | $718,999,616.54    |          4.521 |
|    Unknown      | $435,481.67        |          0.002 |
|    Contract     | $199,689.00        |          0.001 |


Grants account for 95% of the total aid distributed between 2009 and 2023. Loans make up about 4.5%, with the remaining categories making up less than 0.1%. This distribution highlights the significant role of grants in Maryland's operations and its support for various programs and departments.

### Peak Year and Covid-19 Pandemic Aid Distribution

9. **Question 9:** Which year did Maryland distribute the most aids?

```postgresql
WITH
    yearly_total AS (SELECT
                         fiscal_year,
                         SUM(amount) AS total_year_aid
                     FROM
                         maryland_aids_09_23
                     GROUP BY fiscal_year)
SELECT
    fiscal_year,
    TO_CHAR(total_year_aid, '$FM999,999,999,999.00') AS total_aid
FROM
    yearly_total
WHERE
    total_year_aid = (SELECT MAX(total_year_aid) FROM yearly_total);
```
| fiscal_year |     total_aid     |
|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
|     2020    | $2,396,452,132.47 |


Unsurprisingly, 2020 was the peak year for aid distribution, with Maryland providing $2.3 billion in aid.

10. **Question 10:** Since 2020 was the peak year for aid distribution, which was also the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, what was the percentage increase in aid from the previous year, and by what factor did it increase?

```postgresql
WITH
    calc_2019_aids AS (SELECT
                           fiscal_year,
                           SUM(amount) AS total_2019_aids
                       FROM
                           maryland_aids_09_23
                       WHERE
                           fiscal_year = 2019
                       GROUP BY fiscal_year),
    calc_2020_aids AS (SELECT
                           fiscal_year,
                           SUM(amount) AS total_2020_aids
                       FROM
                           maryland_aids_09_23
                       WHERE
                           fiscal_year = 2020
                       GROUP BY fiscal_year)
SELECT
    ROUND(((c20.total_2020_aids - c19.total_2019_aids) / (c19.total_2019_aids)) * 100, 2) AS "percentage_%",
    ROUND(((c20.total_2020_aids / c19.total_2019_aids)), 2) AS factor_increase
FROM
    calc_2019_aids c19,
    calc_2020_aids c20;
```
| percentage_% | factor_increase |
|:------------:|:---------------:|
|    143.06    |       2.43      |


In 2019, Maryland provided 985 million in aid, which jumped to 2.3 billion in 2020â€”a 143% increase. The factor increase was 2.43, meaning Maryland provided 2.43 times more aid in 2020 than in 2019. This dramatic rise was largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

11. **Question 11:** How has the total amount of aid distributed by Maryland changed year-over-year from 2009 to 2023, and what is the percentage increase or decrease each year compared to the previous year?

```postgresql
WITH
    calc_aids_yearly AS (SELECT
                             fiscal_year,
                             SUM(amount) AS total_yearly_aid
                         FROM
                             maryland_aids_09_23
                         GROUP BY fiscal_year
                         ORDER BY fiscal_year),
    previous_total_aid AS (SELECT
                               fiscal_year,
                               LAG(total_yearly_aid) OVER (ORDER BY fiscal_year) AS total_aids
                           FROM
                               calc_aids_yearly)
SELECT
    cay.fiscal_year,
    TO_CHAR(cay.total_yearly_aid, '$FM999,999,999,999.00'),
    ROUND(((cay.total_yearly_aid - pta.total_aids) / pta.total_aids) * 100, 2) AS percentage_increase
FROM
    calc_aids_yearly cay,
    previous_total_aid pta
WHERE
    cay.fiscal_year = pta.fiscal_year;

Seeing the difference between 2019 and 2020, I also wanted to investigate the overall percentage increases and decreases from 2009 to 2023. There is a steady fluctuation between 2009 and 2019, with slight increases and decreases in the overall trend during those years. In 2010, there was a 15.11% decrease in aid compared to 2009, which could indicate budget cuts or possible reallocations. Conversely, in 2012, there was a significant 36.08% increase, possibly indicating more budget allocation for specific programs or initiatives. From 2014 to 2019, there was a steady upward trend, with a noticeable increase of 32.27% in 2015 and 8.46% in 2019.

Following the sharp increase in 2020 due to COVID-19, the aid distribution saw a 34.08% decrease in 2021. This decline could indicate a reduction in emergency funding as the immediate crisis of the pandemic began to subside. From 2021 to 2023, the aid amounts stabilized, with small but positive growth (e.g., a 2.09% increase in 2022 and a 12.61% increase in 2023). These increases suggest a return to more regular funding patterns, possibly with some ongoing support for recovery efforts.

Overall Summary:
The data reveals that Maryland's aid distribution was relatively stable, with moderate fluctuations for most of the period, but the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 caused a dramatic surge in aid. Following this surge, the state adjusted its aid distribution, leading to a decrease in 2021 and a return to a more stable pattern in subsequent years. The analysis highlights how external events, such as a global pandemic, can have a profound impact on state funding allocations.

12. **Question 12:** During 2020, what types of aids were distributed by Maryland?

```postgresql
SELECT
    category,
    TO_CHAR(SUM(amount), '$FM999,999,999,999.00') AS total_aid
FROM
    maryland_aids_09_23
WHERE
    fiscal_year = 2020
GROUP BY
    category;
```
| category |     total_aid     |
|:--------:|:-----------------:|
|  Grant   | $2,311,382,597.15 |
|   Loan   |  $85,069,535.32   |


In 2020, Maryland only distributed two types of aid: Grants and Loans.

13. **Question 13:** Using the data from 2020, what was the cumulative distribution of each aid type?

```postgresql
WITH
    calc_grants_loans AS (SELECT
                              category,

                          WHERE
                              fiscal_year = 2020
                          GROUP BY category),

|   Loan   |  $85,069,535.32   | $2,396,452,132.47 |    3.55%   |


Grants accounted for over 96% of the total aid distributed in 2020, while loans made up only 3.5%. This emphasizes Maryland's focus on grants during this period.

The Department of Education only distributed grants from 2009 to 2023, with no loans or contracts. The total aid provided amounted to 2.2 billion dollars, which accounted for 13.89% of the total aid distributed by Maryland. This demonstrates Maryland's strong commitment to providing quality education and opportunities to its residents. The 13.89% figure does not take into account other educational agencies, which could significantly increase the total aid.

When examining the total grants provided by the Department of Education year by year, we observe major fluctuations and spikes in the overall trend. From 2009 to 2014, there was a steady increase in the amount of aid provided by the Department of Education. In 2015, however, there was a significant increase, with aid more than tripling compared to the previous year. This was followed by a sharp decrease from 2015 to 2019.

A noticeable dip occurred in 2018 when the Department of Education provided only 10 million dollars in aid, the lowest amount even when compared to 2009. However, there was a sharp spike in aid in 2020, with over 1 billion dollars allocated. This could indicate that the Maryland government allocated more budget to the Department of Education in response to the prevalence of COVID-19 and the associated lockdowns, which forced all schools and institutions to close and shift to an online format. As schools transitioned to online learning, they needed to provide materials such as laptops, which could explain the substantial budget increase in 2020.

After 2020, there appears to have been a budget cut and a decrease in funding, as aid dropped from 1 billion dollars in 2020 to 155 million dollars in 2021. This trend continued over the next two years, in 2022 and 2023, likely due to schools reopening for in-person instruction, which alleviated the Department of Educationâ€™s need for such a large budget and allowed them to return to pre-COVID funding levels.

19. **Question 19:** Were all grants and loans given to organizations within Maryland, or were they any out-of-state or foreign organizations that received aid?
